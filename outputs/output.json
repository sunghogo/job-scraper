You will work in person in our Miami Beach, FL office and participate in daily standup meetings, weekly sprint meetings(or a more fluid Kanban process), and hold yourself accountable to an aggressive product development roadmap. We are an early-stage startup and oftentimes that comes with wearing many hats, which means working across front-end and back-end as well as potentially participating in or leading system architecture or DevOps decision-making.\nAs the organization scales, you will have the opportunity to scale into a leadership role if your performance is strong and you wish to become a leader.
