# JobScraper

This is a microservice that scrapes job listings from popular job boards, and serves the job data in JSON. Currently, the data is served as .json files in outputs, but later on will be integrated into the REST client.

This runs using Docker and docker-compose, and can be built and started using this docker command:
docker-compose up --build
